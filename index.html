        <h3>Reform the Associations Structure at HSG</h3>
        <span>🏒 🏐 🌱 📈</span>
        <p>Currently, the tendency at HSG is, that there are increasingly bigger associations, that are supposed to cover all topics. Accreditation requests of smaller societies are granted less and less, and the entire process is tediously long. Thereby, the HSG loses out on the innovation potential of many motivated students. The large remaining associations, tend to become slow, lacking behind and allow less room for creativity and entrepreneurial activities. Getting an accredited association, should be a matter of days (like it is in most universities), not months or years. The accreditation process is unnecessarily complicated, and the accreditation decisions can sometimes seem arbitrary. Therefore, I aim to liberalise the accreditation guidelines, to allow for more creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit at HSG. </p>
        <h3>More Equitable Exam Preparation for the Students</h3>
        <span>👩🏿 👨 💯</span>
        <p>Currently, some professors offer practice/older exams, while others do not. However often, there are old exams circulating among the students, even if they have not been officially published. This leads to a situation, where the more well-connected students, will have inevitably better resources at hand to prepare for an exam. Old exams getting leaked is a “problem” that will persist. Therefore, I want to level the playing field, by requiring professors to simply publish their old exams. Thereby, everybody has the same resources, and the quality of the individual student’s exam preparation improves.</p>
        <h3>Create More Quiet Study Places</h3>
        <span>🤫📗😌</span>
        <p>Currently, with the new SQUARE, a lot of focus is put on interaction & communication. However, while interaction & communication should happen (for example in new, innovative associations or initiatives), in order to study well, focus & peace are a key factor. While this is offered at some places, such as the library, these places are often overcrowded, especially during the Lernphase. I want to make more room for students to study quietly, such as e.g. certain rooms of the SQUARE, or the empty lecture rooms, everywhere available during the Lernphase. By decreasing the inputs the student’s brain must process (like in a noisy SQUARE), we can increase the flow the student experiences while studying, which in the end also leads to an improved mental health and a deeper understanding of the subject matter by the students.</p>
